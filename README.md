## About The Project

Snowball is a low-weight, dynamically typed, object oriented programming language with garbage collector and module system.

Features:
* Object oriented programming
* It is memory safe
* Built-in functions for better productions
* Faster than other programming lanugages
* Garbage collector
* Unit testing

It has a lot more features that can be explored! You can check them out in the [documentation]().

## Getting Started with Snowball

### Installation

Before we get started, you'll need to have snowball installed into your compuiter. Linux and macOS users, you are in luck! You can use this simple command to download snowball and get started.

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowball-lang/snowball/dev/scripts/install.sh | bash -s
```

### Writing Your First Snowball Program

First, you will need a new snowball project. For that, create a new directory and execute the following command:

```
mkdir myProject
cd myProject

snowball init
```

### Executing snowball code

In order to execute snowball code, you can run the following command to build **and** run the program:

```
snowball run
```

## How does snowball feel?

Here is an example of a class in snowball.

```rs
use Core::System

class Vector {

    priv let x: i32 = 0
    priv let y: i32 = 0

  pub:
    Vector(x: Int, y: Int) {
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    }

    // JS equivalent: const __sum = (this, vec2) => new Vector(...)
    // overrides operator +
    operator +(vec2: Vector) Vector =>
        new Vector(self.x + vec2.x, self.y + vec2.y)

    operator str() String {
        return "Vector(x=${self.x} y=${self.y})"
    }
}

fn main() Int {
    let vec1 = new Vector(1,2)
    let vec2 = new Vector(10,22)

    System::println(vec1 + vec2)
    return 0
}
```

## Roadmap

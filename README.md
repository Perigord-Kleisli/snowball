## About The Project

üëã Greetings! Allow me to introduce you to Snowball, a dynamically-typed, low-weight, object-oriented programming language complete with a garbage collector and module system.

üöÄ With a myriad of features to offer, Snowball boasts object-oriented programming, memory safety, built-in functions for enhanced productivity, and faster execution than other languages. Plus, its garbage collector and unit testing make it a comprehensive tool for developers.

üîç So why not dive in and explore Snowball's capabilities? For more information, check out the [installation guide](#installation). Happy coding!

## Getting Started with Snowball

### Installation

Before we get started, you'll need to have snowball installed into your compuiter. Linux and macOS users, you are in luck! You can use this simple command to download snowball and get started.

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowball-lang/snowball/dev/scripts/install.sh | bash -s
```

### Writing Your First Snowball Program

First, you will need a new snowball project. For that, create a new directory and execute the following command:

```
mkdir myProject
cd myProject

snowball init
```

### Executing snowball code

In order to execute snowball code, you can run the following command to build **and** run the program:

```
snowball run
```

## How does snowball feel?

Here is an example of a class in snowball.

```rs
use Core::System

class Vector {

    priv let x: i32 = 0
    priv let y: i32 = 0

  pub:
    Vector(x: Int, y: Int) {
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    }

    // JS equivalent: const __sum = (this, vec2) => new Vector(...)
    // overrides operator +
    operator +(vec2: Vector) Vector =>
        new Vector(self.x + vec2.x, self.y + vec2.y)

    operator str() String {
        return "Vector(x=${self.x} y=${self.y})"
    }
}

fn main() Int {
    let vec1 = new Vector(1,2)
    let vec2 = new Vector(10,22)

    System::println(vec1 + vec2)
    return 0
}
```

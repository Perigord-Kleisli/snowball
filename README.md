## About The Project

üëã Greetings! Allow me to introduce you to Snowball, a statically-typed, low-weight, object-oriented programming language complete with a garbage collector and module system.

üöÄ With a myriad of features to offer, Snowball boasts object-oriented programming, memory safety, built-in functions for enhanced productivity, and faster execution than other languages. Plus, its garbage collector and unit testing make it a comprehensive tool for developers.

üîç So why not dive in and explore Snowball's capabilities? For more information, check out the [installation guide](#installation). Happy coding!

## Getting Started with Snowball

### Installation

Before we get started, you'll need to have snowball installed into your compuiter. Linux and macOS users, you are in luck! You can use this simple command to download snowball and get started.

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowball-lang/snowball/dev/scripts/install.sh | sudo -E bash -s -- -y
```

### Installation from source (unix)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/snowball-lang/snowball
cd snowball

# INSTALL REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
sh ./build_scripts/install_deps.sh

sh ./build_scripts/release.sh
sudo make install -j100
```

**note**: We use -j100 to create *100 threads* to make the compilation faster. This will make your computer slower, it can be removed.

### Writing Your First Snowball Program

First, you will need a new snowball project. For that, create a new directory and execute the following command:

```
mkdir myProject
cd myProject

snowball init
```

### Executing snowball code

In order to execute snowball code, you can run the following command to build **and** run the program:

```
snowball run
```

## How does snowball feel?

Here is an example of a class in snowball.

```kt
import Core::System;

public func main() i32 {
    System::println("Hello, world! üê±");
}
```
